It is simple web crawler that locates “Everything OK” button on every page. This is my first web crawler, so do not judge me strictly.
To run this program you need to:
1. [Install Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-beautiful-soup) : pip3 install bs4
2. Run web_crawler.py
